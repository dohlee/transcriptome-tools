# Preparing test data

## Download short read sequencing data
Gene expression profiles of breast cancer cells are available at Gene Expression Omnibus ([GSE58135](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE58135)). There are bunch of paired-end RNA-seq data sequenced from breast cancer cell lines, ER-positive breast cancer cells, and triple-negative breast cancer cells.

There are a few ways to obtain this data. In this tutorial, we are going to use Europian Nucleotide Archive (ENA). Fortunately, ENA FTP is well-managed so that we can programmatically download sequence data. `scripts/fastq-dump-ena.py` allows us to download short read sequence data conveniently. 

**Usage**

```shell
./scripts/fastq-dump-ena.py ACCESSION [-p] [-o output]
```
**Options**
`-p` : Add this option if the data to be downloaded is paired-end sequences.
`-o output`: Specify output directory

Now, download *SRR1313090*, which is sequenced from ER+ breast cancer cells, and takes about 5GB. This step might take while depending on the speed of your Internet connection. Don't forget to specify `-p` option since the data is generated by paired-end sequencing method. Also, check if you have enough remaining storage.

```shell
./scripts/fastq-dump-ena.py SRR1313090 -p -o data/SRR1313090
```

## Generate test data from downloaded data
Since the data is too big for the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to do some random sampling from the data to reduce the size of test data.
